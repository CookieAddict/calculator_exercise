Basic calculator written in TypeScript.

Minimal installation steps required:
```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
``` 

Run the calculator from project root:
```
npm run calculator
```

To Dos:
 - Implement parentheses support
 - Add tests
 - Break up `parseCommand` function into smaller, more manageable blocks
 - Verify resilience against more unexpected inputs
 - Beautify CLI interface/outputs display
